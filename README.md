# IEEE_BSU_TUTORIALS

Tutorials presented for the BSU IEEE Student Branch workshops.

All the code presented are crap and make no sense outside the workshop. However, I think the examples are relavant enough to
make some of the concepts clear.

## Installing Homebrew for OSX users

$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
